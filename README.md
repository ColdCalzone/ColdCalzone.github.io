### Project one: Bread Bread Breadvolution  
This project was made for the [26th Godot Wild Jam](https://itch.io/jam/godot-wild-jam-26).  
This was my first submission despite being in the server for a few months and it scored 8th place overall, which is *incredible* and is way higher than I expected!

### Project two: Tic Tac Toe AI  
This Project was just to learn how to make AI. I made it based on a python tutorial but written in gdscript. It helped me to learn how simple an algorithm really is! [Here's part one of the tutorial.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5s_lGC2sxwQ)

### Project three: Fire & Fondness 2: Enhanced Edition 
This project is the bgigest undertaking I've had yet. This is a mod of [John Gabriel's](https://johngabrieluk.itch.io) [Fire & Fondness 2](https://johngabrieluk.itch.io/fire-and-fondness-2) adding an extra seven levels and several components. It was of course made with Godot.

### Project four: Minimal Brainfuck Interpretter
This project was made to learn C++. [BrainFuck](https://esolangs.org/wiki/Brainfuck) is an easy to implement language, with several pieces of example code to test against to make a faithful implementation.
