### Project one: Bread Bread Breadvolution  
This project was made for the [26th Godot Wild Jam](https://itch.io/jam/godot-wild-jam-26).  
This was my first submission despite being in the server for a few months and it scored 8th place overall, which is *incredible* and is way higher than I expected!

### Project two: Tic Tac Toe AI  
This Project was just to learn how to make AI. I made it based on a python tutorial but written in gdscript. It helped me to learn how simple an algorithm really is! [Here's part one of the tutorial.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5s_lGC2sxwQ)

### Project five: Discord Plays
This project is a remiplementation of a feature of an abandoned project which will never see the light of day. This effectively allows Discord to control your computer, and is intended to let a Discord server host a game night with a host straming and viewers watching and controlling the game in real time. Due to the nature of this bot, it cannot be hosted publically as a normal bot, and must be ran in a new instance on the host's computer. Instructions, source code, and examples can be seen in the repository below.
