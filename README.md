### Project one: Bread Bread Breadvolution  
This project was made for the [26th Godot Wild Jam](https://itch.io/jam/godot-wild-jam-26).  
This was my first submission despite being in the server for a few months and it scored 8th place overall, which is *incredible* and is way higher than I expected!

### Project two: Tic Tac Toe AI  
This Project was just to learn how to make AI. I made it based on a python tutorial but written in gdscript. It helped me to learn how simple an algorithm really is! [Here's part one of the tutorial.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5s_lGC2sxwQ)
