	<h3 id="project-five-discord-plays">Project five: Discord Plays</h3>
	<p>This project is a remiplementation of a feature of an abandoned project which will never see the light of day. This effectively allows Discord to control your computer, and is intended to let a Discord server host a game night with a host straming and viewers watching and controlling the game in real time. Due to the nature of this bot, it cannot be hosted publically as a normal bot, and must be ran in a new instance on the host’s computer. Instructions, source code, and examples can be seen in the repository below.</p>
