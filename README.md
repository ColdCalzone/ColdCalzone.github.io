## Project one: Bread Bread Breadvolution
This project was made for the [26th Godot Wild Jam](https://itch.io/jam/godot-wild-jam-26).\n
This was my first submission despite being in the server for a few months and it scored 8th place overall, which is *incredible* and is way higher than I expected!\n
