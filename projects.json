This effectively allows Discord to control your computer, and is intended to let a Discord server host a game night with a host streaming and viewers watching and controlling the game in real time. Due to the nature of this bot, it cannot be hosted publically as a normal bot, and must be ran in a new instance on the host’s computer. Instructions, source code, and examples can be seen in the repository below. (COMING SOON)",
